We want to open a space for those of you that could not attend our first information session. So, We will have a second one, in which we 
will cover most of the same material we discussed in the first session, but we will be able to answer more questions, and talk about 
more course details...

Please feel free to attend. There will be snacks!


**Remember!!!** 
Tuesday April 12th, at 2:30 pm in the Biodiversity Building Room 225 (second floor).



Don't know where is it?, don't worry... here is a map
