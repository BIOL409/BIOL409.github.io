We want to thank you all for your interest and enthusiasm to join the 409 field course. We are really sorry to miss this opportunity to bring you all to the tropics.  For those of you who are not graduating, there is a good chance we'll be able to run the course next summer 2021.. 

Please take care, and stay safe in these difficult times.
