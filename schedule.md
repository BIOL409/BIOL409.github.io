subtitle: A (tentative) schedule of events

This schedule is subject to change as our plans evolve, days denoted as _fieldwork_ imply that there is not much travelling involved, 
but activities at the field stations, such as data collection, discussions, presentations, etc.

Our base in Cusco will be the [Hostel Qorichaska](http://www.qorichaskaperu.com), located five blocks from the city center (Plaza de Armas). 
We will send a list of people and dates to arrange accommodation as a group, so you don't have to arrange accommodation by yourself.
