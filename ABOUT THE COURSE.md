## What will students do during the course?

Students will explore how species and habitats shift along one of the most diverse biological gradients onthe planet and consider 
the various threats and conservation challenges in the region.

## Course description

The field course will be held in southeastern Peru, and we will explore Manu Biosphere Reserve and surrounding areas. The course will run for three weeks 
(June 27th - July 15th, 2016). During this course you will be exposed to various ecosystems from the highest elevations of the Andes and down the eastern slope, starting wtih Cusco and descending into the Amazon basin, where we will visit the remote field station of Cocha Cashu. We will also have a chance to see Machu Picchu and other ruins near Cusco. 

Students will conduct indepedent and group research projects during the course, using data collected at each station and comparing data across the gradient. 
Designing and carrying out these projects, as well as analyzing and presenting data, will be important components of student evaluation.

To emphasize and appreciate natural history of tropical species, there will be a field identification portion – e.g., species reports – where students are assigned a species of plant or animal. When we encounter this species in the field, the student should be ready to present their species to the rest of the group.
 
*Readings*: A series of tropical ecology and conservation papers and book chapters will be assigned prior to the course. These will be available in a bound booklet for students.
