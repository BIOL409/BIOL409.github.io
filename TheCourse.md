This two-week field course will introduce the students in field methods used in ecology and research challenges of the tropical forest.  Visiting a series of research stations from the Amazon basin to the High Andes students will experience the tropical diversity, ecosystems and communities first-hand in one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world [**Manu Biosphere Reserve**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man√∫_National_Park).

### When is it?
Summer 2016.
 **July 4th to July 22th**


### Course description
This field course has been designed to engage students in the formulation and execution of ecological research studies, using several basic methods in ecology. This course gives the students the opportunity to do research in the tropics and develop their skills to do field-based research. 

_**During this course students will have the opportunity to**_

* Apply basic methods in Ecology.
* Develop skills in data collection.
* Design and conduct independent and group research projects.
* Apply their skills and creativity to solve challenges of ecological field research.
* Identify and propose alternative to the central challenges of ecologist.
* Work in teams to analyse and present research projects.
* Develop appreciation for the natural history of the tropical ecosystems.

Additionally students will explore how species and habitats shift along one of the most diverse biological gradients on the planet and consider the various threats and conservation challenges in the region.

## Costs
Trip costs include airfare from Vancouver to Cusco, lodging, food and ground or boat transportation from Cusco to and from each of the stations. We will try our best to keep costs as low as possible, but you should expect to pay around $2000 for the trip, in addition to airfare. Round trip tickets from Vancouver to Cuzco are just under $1000 if tickets are purchased far enough in advance. The cost per student also depends on the currency exchange rate during the summer (here's hoping that the CAD bounces back) and the number of students attending (with more students the per individual cost will be reduced with shared food and transportation costs).
