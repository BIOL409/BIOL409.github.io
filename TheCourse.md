In this three-week field course, students will explore topics of tropical diversity, ecology and conservation. You will be introduced to field methods used in ecology as well as the challenges of research in Neotropical forests. Visiting a suite of biological stations from the high Andes to the Amazon basin, students will experience tropical ecosystems first-hand in one of the most spectacular biodiversity hotspots of the world [**Manu Biosphere Reserve**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man√∫_National_Park).

### When is it?
Summer 2020.
 **July 18th to August 9th**


### Course description
This course is designed to engage students in the formulation and execution of ecological field research studies while gaining an understanding of major themes in tropical ecology and conservation. 

Students will conduct indepedent and group research projects during the course, using data collected at each research station and comparing data across the gradient. Designing and carrying out these projects, as well as analyzing and presenting data, will be important components of student evaluation.

A important part of this course will be study of the natural history of tropical species. 

Importantly, students will explore how species and habitats shift along one of the most diverse biological gradients on the planet and consider the various threats and conservation challenges in the region.

_**During this course students will have the opportunity to**_

* Apply basic methods in field ecology.
* Develop skills in data collection.
* Design and conduct independent and group research projects.
* Use skills and creativity to address challenges in ecological field research.
* Work in teams to analyse and present research projects.
* Develop an appreciation for the natural history of tropical ecosystems.

## Costs
Trip costs include lodging, food and ground or boat transportation from Cusco to and from each of the stations for the duration of the course. Some of these places are remote and hard to access. We will try our best to keep costs as low as possible, but you should expect to pay around $2000 CAD for the trip. The cost per student also depends on the currency exchange rate during the summer and the number of students attending (with more students the per individual cost will be reduced with shared food and transportation costs).

In addition, students will have to cover airfare to Cusco. Round trip tickets from Vancouver to Cusco are just under $1000 if tickets are purchased far enough in advance. You are also expected to pay tuition for the course. BIOL 409 is a three credit course and summer registration fees and regular per credit rates apply.
